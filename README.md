# EdTech Course Optimization with Market Intelligence & Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This project aims to help an EdTech startup optimize its recorded lecture offerings by analyzing data collected from various online learning platforms. Using Python, we clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover insights that drive strategic decision-making.

## Objectives & Insights
The analysis is structured around **seven key goals** that guide the EdTech company in improving their offerings:

### 1. **Course Distribution Across Categories & Subcategories**
   - Examined the distribution of course types across categories.
   - Identified the **most and least popular categories**.
   - Counted the number of courses by **category and subcategory** to help allocate resources efficiently.

### 2. **Average Views per Category, Subcategory, and Language**
   - Analyzed the **average number of views** for each category and subcategory.
   - Provided insights into **learner engagement trends** based on content topics.
   - Explored the impact of **language on viewership**.

### 3. **Most Commonly Taught Skills in Each Category**
   - Identified **trending skills** within each category.
   - Used text analysis and word clouds to **highlight in-demand topics**.
   - Ensured course offerings align with **market and job trends**.

### 4. **Language Distribution of Courses**
   - Analyzed the **language diversity** in recorded lectures.
   - Helped in decision-making about whether to introduce **new language offerings**.

### 5. **Impact of Subtitles on Course Views**
   - Investigated whether courses with **subtitles** receive higher engagement.
   - Visualized trends to understand **accessibility improvements** and learner preferences.

### 6. **Top Instructors per Category & Subcategory**
   - Ranked instructors based on **ratings** within each category and subcategory.
   - Identified **top three educators** to help the startup **collaborate with high-quality content creators**.

### 7. **Relationship Between Course Duration & Viewership**
   - Analyzed how **course length impacts viewer engagement**.
   - Recommended **optimal course durations** to maximize completion rates.
   - Ensured structured scheduling, e.g., **60 hours per month for structured courses** and **200 hours for flexible schedules**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data analysis
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **WordCloud** for skill analysis
- **NumPy** for numerical calculations

## Results & Business Impact
- Provided **data-driven insights** to improve course planning and optimize learner engagement.
- Helped the startup **identify high-potential courses & instructors**.
- Suggested **content strategies** based on market demand and engagement patterns.



This project provides a strong foundation for **data-driven decision-making** in the EdTech industry.
